        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <h3>Presentation of HelloAsso</h3>
        <p>
        HelloAsso is a French online platform that supports non-profit organizations and associations. Founded in 2009, it has become a key actor in the French non-profit sector. The platform allows associations to manage fundraising, memberships, event ticketing, crowdfunding campaigns, and more. 
        What makes HelloAsso different from other platforms is its social and solidarity-based model.
        </p>

        <h3>Presentation of the Team</h3>
        <p>
        During this internship, I was supervised by three people: Didier Colin, Research Director and internship supervisor; Frédérique Castagnac, Chief Data Officer; and Erwan Olivier, Data Scientist. They helped me structure my work and improve my analysis.
        </p>

        <p>
        I also presented my work to the executive committee, which included Léa Thomassin, President of HelloAsso; Pedro Mendoza Sevilla, Chief Financial Officer; and Nicolas Vonthron, Chief Executive Officer. These meetings helped refine the project objectives and align the work with the needs of the final users.
        </p>

        <h2>The Internship</h2>

        <h3>Objectives</h3>
        <p>
        HelloAsso’s business model is based on voluntary contributions from users. When a payment is made on the platform, a suggested contribution is displayed. This contribution is optional and can be modified by the user. All company revenue comes from these voluntary contributions.
        </p>

        <p>
        Understanding long-term generosity behavior is therefore essential for the sustainability of HelloAsso’s business model. The goal of this project was to use historical data to build forecasting models. These forecasts help anticipate annual budgets, monitor revenue month by month or week by week, and estimate potential losses in case of platform issues.
        </p>

        <h3>Overview of the Project</h3>
        <p>
        The internship was divided into three main steps. First, I analyzed the data. This step was essential to understand the problem and prepare the forecasting phase. Second, I evaluated different models: SARIMA and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks. I compared their performance using the RMSE metric. Finally, I developed a combined approach with a day-by-day forecasting method.
