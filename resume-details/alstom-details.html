        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <h3>Presentation of ALSTOM</h3>
        <p>
          ALSTOM is a well-known French company that manufactures rolling stock and was founded in 1928. The company operates globally in the rail transport sector and employs over eighty thousand people. ALSTOM operates in various sectors including passenger transport and signalling systems, producing a variety of trains, including high-speed, suburban, regional and urban trains, as well as trams.
        </p>
        <p>
          During my internship, I joined the Building Information Modeling (BIM) department, which is a fast-growing team. Although the BIM department is relatively new, established less than three years ago, it has grown significantly and now has about ten dedicated professionals, 18 with the interns. 
        </p>
        <h3>Presentation of BIM</h3>
        <p>
          Building Information Modelling (BIM) is more than digital geometry. It integrates data on time, cost, sustainability and functionality. Unlike traditional CAD (Computer-Aided Design), BIM provides a complete view of a project, helping engineers make better decisions, enhance collaboration, increase productivity and ensure timely delivery.
        </p>
        <p>
          BIM converts 2D plans into 3D models, retains information from earlier stages, reduces risks and costs, improves visualization, and streamlines communication. It also minimizes disputes, redesign work, and supports better management during construction and operation phases.
        </p>

        <h2>The internship</h2>
        <h3>The Objectives</h3>
        <p>
          During my internship at ALSTOM, I focused on a research and development project titled "BIM Library." The primary objective of this project is to establish a centralized library that consolidates all data related to Building Information Modelling objects. This involved systematically retrieving project metadata, implementing asset tagging, developing scripts and creating comprehensive process and method sheets.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the lead of this project, I was responsible for overseeing all parts of the research and development activities. This was a complete initiative that started from scratch, requiring teamwork from all members to ensure its success. Keeping a clear view of the project goals and encouraging teamwork were key to achieving our goals. We aimed solve common problems such as inconsistent data formats, delays in finding elements, disorganized file storage, difficulties in accessing and sharing content and duplicate work across teams. By addressing these challenges, we wanted to make accessing BIM resources easier and improve the overall efficiency of the processes in ALSTOM for the BIM team. Ultimately, our goal was to create an user-friendly library that simplifies the management and sharing of BIM content between the teams.
        </p>
        <h3>The Team</h3>
        <p>
          For this project, we were four interns from different schools, each bringing unique skills to the team. I worked with Kacper Brossard - Designer, Thandar Lwin - BIM Support and Wassim Hmidy - Developper. The project was managed under the guidance of Garance Marion - AI and Data Science Engineer and by Hugues Zarka - Digital Strategy & Innovation Expert - who ensures that the project aligns with the overall strategic goals of the department and facilitates collaboration between team members. 
        </p>
        <p>
          My initial focus was to define the project scope and coordinate the team's efforts. I established the workflows, worked on the database and guided the creation of the interfaces necessary for the BIM Library. During the development phase, I worked on the plug-ins and WinDev.
